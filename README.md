# Market_segmentation-in-R

This is a walkthrough from the book "Market Segmentation Analysis"

The notebook will take you through a series of customer survey datasets together with different clustering and segmentation algorithms with a purpose of being able to extract/discover market segements in the data whilst also attempting to answer the question "which is the best clustering algorithm?"
